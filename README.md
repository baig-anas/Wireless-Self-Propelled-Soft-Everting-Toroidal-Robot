# Wireless-Self-Propelled-Soft-Everting-Toroidal-Robot

Upload the copy1 code on Arduino IDE to an MKR Arduino WiFi 1010 board plugged into an MKR Carrier board.

3D print the STL files and assemble the propelling device with the arduino on top, 9V-12V battery on one side and 12V DC motors with
the rollers attached to the shaft. Guided wheels will go on the front and rear of the robot. 

When fully assembled, a plastic membrane needs to be wrapped around it in a toroidal shape and heat sealing it with a heat sealer.
